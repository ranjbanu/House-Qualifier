# House-Qualifier
Build a Classification model to classify the house using the target variable Qualified

# Steps involved

# Import libraries
Import pandas, numpy and modelling libraries in Python 3

# Data exploration and preprocessing
Data cleaning, imputing values and transformation using wrangling techniques

# Build models using various classifiers based on basic hyperparameters
Fit the model on the training data using various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees etc

# Choose a final model
Based on the accuracy of the models, choose the model giving the most accurate results, provide the appropriate hyperparaters and fit the model.  Predict the results on the testing data using the selected model

# Identify the important features
Identify the important features using feature importance and refit the model using the important features and predict the results.

# Prediction
Save the results in the .csv format.
